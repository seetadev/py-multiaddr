## 🚀 Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary testing dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

### Running Tests in This Directory Only

To run only the tests in this directory:

```bash
# Run all tests in this directory
npx jest .github/claude/tests

# Run tests with coverage
npx jest .github/claude/tests --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npx jest .github/claude/tests --watch
```

### Running Specific Test Files

```bash
# Run a specific test file
npx jest .github/claude/tests/specific-test.test.ts
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

Target coverage: **80%**

To check coverage for these tests:

```bash
npx jest .github/claude/tests --coverage
```

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Framework: jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
- Uses describe() and test() functions to structure tests
- Built-in assertion library with expect()
- Powerful mocking capabilities with jest.mock()
- Snapshot testing for React components

## 📝 Test Structure

Each test file follows these conventions:

- **Descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Proper setup and teardown** for clean test environments
- **Mocked dependencies** for isolated testing
- **Edge case testing** for robust error handling
- **Clear assertions** that validate expected behavior

## 🎯 Test Types Generated


- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Component Tests**: Testing React components with user interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions and data flow
- **Service Tests**: Testing API calls and business logic
            

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Place tests in appropriate subdirectories
3. Use the same testing patterns and setup
4. Update this README if you add new categories

### Updating Tests

When source code changes:

1. Review related test files
2. Update test cases as needed
3. Ensure coverage targets are maintained
4. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed
2. **Mock failures**: Verify that mocks match the actual API
3. **Async issues**: Ensure proper async/await handling
4. **Environment setup**: Check test environment configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npx jest --verbose

# Run tests with debugging
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand
```

## 🤝 Contributing

When contributing new tests:

1. Follow the existing patterns and conventions
2. Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
3. Use descriptive test names and clear assertions
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Mock external dependencies appropriately
